# Missing Features

- Currently, we have a drop-down coding language selector. Right now, no matter which language you select, the problem sets are based on Python. We will iterate lessons for more languages in Iteration 2.
- Currently, we only offer one method for Syntax learning (multiple choice). The 'Flashcards' button is not yet functional. We will introduce this feature in Iteration 2.
